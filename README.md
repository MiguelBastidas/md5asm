# md5asm
MD5 implementation in AT&amp;T assembly for the IA32 ISA. This was a project for the course "Organisation and Structure of
Computing Devices". Made in conjunction with [@efralejandro](https://github.com/efralejandro).

It was designed to mimic some of the functionalities of the md5sum linux utility. Namely, the ouput format and multiple 
input files.
